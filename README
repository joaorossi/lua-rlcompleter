rlcompleter provides readline completion to the Lua interpreter. It is
copyright Jay Carlson 2004 and copyright Reuben Thomas 2011, and is
released under the MIT license, like Lua. There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions to the email address above.


Installation
------------

    make

You may well need to edit the Makefile, which has only been tested on
Linux; patches to make it more general are welcome. Install
rlcompleter.lua and rlcompleter_c.so (or equivalent) on LUA_PATH and
LUA_CPATH respectively.


Use
---

require "rlcompleter"

You may want to put this in your LUA_INIT. Then in the interpreter
(which must have been built with LUA_USE_READLINE) you can press Tab
to complete the current identifier.
