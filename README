rlcompleter provides readline completion to the Lua interpreter. It is
released under the MIT license, like Lua. There is no warranty.

Please report bugs and make suggestions at the web site above.


Installation
------------

    luarocks make rlcompleter-*-1.rockspec


Use
---

require "rlcompleter"

You may want to put this in your LUA_INIT. Then in the interpreter
(which must have been built with LUA_USE_READLINE) you can press Tab
to complete the current identifier, filename or other token.
